# ErgoDox 3D Printable Case

## About

3D printable case for original ErgoDox keyboard. Originally this case was developed by Dox, but
I little improve this design:

- Uses M3 inserts for connect top and bottom parts of this case.
- Printed anti-slip feets.

Originally two parts of case was connected using only M3 screws. But this connection type is not reusable.
Thus this model uses M3x4 infused inserts along with short M3 screws for better connectivity.

Anti-slip feets printed from TPU and stick to bottom part of case.
